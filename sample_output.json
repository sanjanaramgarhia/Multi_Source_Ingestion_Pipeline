    "title": "Btrfs Has Many Nice Improvements, Better Performance With Linux 5.11",
    "content": "The first set of major file-system material submitted for the newly opened   merge window are the Btrfs updates.  The Btrfs file-system updates this time around are on the heavier side with a variety of enhancements throughout:  - The Btrfs   mount option can now accept values of using the backup root (usebackuproot), ignoring bad roots (ignorebadroots), ignoring data checksums (ignoredatacums), and all (all).  - Exporting more Btrfs file-system information to user-space.  - Fixes around the async discard handling under high load conditions.  - Free space tree fixes.  - The Direct I/O conversion to the IOmap infrastructure has been completed.  - Prep work to support data and metadata blocks that are smaller than the pagesize.  - Preparing for 64K pages on ARM64 and POWER 64-bit.  - Scrub read-only support.  - General performance improvements with upwards of \"tens of percent\" for some workloads.  On the performance front there are optimizations to avoid unnecessary work, speed-ups targeting Dbench, avoiding unnecessary searches for extended attributes (xattrs) when logging an inode, tree log improvements, and more. I'll be running some Btrfs Linux 5.11 file-system benchmarks soon.  The full list of Btrfs updates for Linux 5.11 can be found via the  . Stay tuned for benchmarks and barring any unseen regressions this looks like a very nice Christmas gift to users of this Linux file-system.",

    "content": "Python is one of the most popular programming languages. It\u2019s simple to use, packed with features and supported by a wide range of libraries and frameworks. Its clean syntax makes it beginner-friendly. The following is a simple program that displays the message \u201cHello, World!\u201d on the screen. To understand working of this code, refer to our articlePython Introduction. In this section, we\u2019ll cover the basics of Python programming, including installing Python, writing first program, understanding comments and working with variables, keywords and operators. Before starting to learn python we need toinstall pythonon our system. In this section of Python 3 tutorial we'll explore Python function syntax, parameter handling, return values and variable scope. Along the way, we'll also introduce versatile functions like range(), map, filter and lambda functions. Python offers versatile collections of data types, including lists, string, tuples, sets, dictionaries and arrays. In this section, we will learn about each data types in detail. Python's collections module offers essential data structures, including the following: To learn data structure and algorithm with python in detail, you can refer to ourDSA with PythonTutorial. In this section, we'll explore the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. From encapsulation to inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes and iterators, we'll cover the essential concepts that helps you to build modular, reusable and scalable code. In this section, we'll explore Python Exception Handling that how Python deals with unexpected errors, enabling us to write fault-tolerant code. We'll cover file handling, including reading from and writing to files. In this section, we will cover file handling, including reading from and writing to files. In this section we will learn how to access and work with MySQL and MongoDB databases Python is a huge collection of Python Packages standard libraries that make development easier. These libraries help with a wide range of tasks and can save you a lot of time by providing ready-to-use tools. Some commonly used types of libraries in Python include: 1. Foundational Libraries: These are the libraries that form the base for all data science work. Start here to build a strong foundation. 2. Advanced Visualization and Statistical Tools:Once you\u2019re comfortable with basic data handling and visualization, move to creating cleaner visuals and performing statistical analysis. 3. Machine Learning Libraries:After data manipulation and visualization, learn machine learning, starting with simpler models and moving to advanced ones. 4.Deep Learning Frameworks:If you\u2019re interested in AI and deep learning, these libraries will allow you to build and train neural networks. To learn more, you can refer toPython for Data Science. 1. Core Web Frameworks (Backend Development with Python):These are the tools for building Python-based web applications. 2. Database Integration:Learn how to connect Python web frameworks to databases for storing and retrieving data. 3. Front-End and Backend Integration:Learn how to connect Python backends with front-end technologies to create dynamic, full-stack web applications. 4. API Development:Learn to build APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for connecting your backend with front-end apps or other services. To learn more, you can refer toPython for Web Development. Python quiz page covers topics including variables, data types, input, output, lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets. The Python Coding Practice Problems page offers exercises on loops, functions, lists, strings, dictionaries, sets and advanced structures like heaps and deques. This Python tutorial is updated based on latest Python 3.13.1 version.",
